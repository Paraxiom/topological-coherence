### 5. Suggested Reviewers (optional but helpful)
Consider suggesting:
- **Michel Planat** (Topic Editor — he may assign himself or select reviewers)
- **Hector Zenil** (cited in paper — information-theoretic foundations)
- **Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde** (cited — Neural Latent Geometry Search, NeurIPS 2023)
- **James Phillips** (cited — geometric hallucination detection, Oxford)

### 6. Declarations
- No external funding
- No conflicts of interest
- Data available at GitHub repo
- Not submitted elsewhere
- Preprint exists on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18516477)

### 7. Submit
- Review all entries
- Click Submit
- You'll receive a confirmation email

## Expected Timeline
- Editorial check: 1-3 days
- Peer review: 2-4 weeks (MDPI is fast)
- Revision (if needed): 1-2 weeks
- Publication: ~1-2 months from submission

## Notes
- MDPI accepts free-format submissions — no need to use their LaTeX template for initial submission
- If accepted, they'll ask you to reformat using the MDPI template (available at https://www.mdpi.com/authors/latex)
- The Zenodo preprint is fine — MDPI allows preprints
- Open access: the published version will be freely available
